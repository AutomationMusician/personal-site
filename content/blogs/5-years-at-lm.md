# Celebrating Success

I am so excited to announce that I have officially worked at Lockheed Martin for 5 years! The work I have been doing has been so fulfilling and exciting. I have learned so much and have had significant accomplishments along the way.

As I leave the program that I have been working on for the past 3 years and transition to a new one, there are new and exciting challenges and areas of growth for me, and I eagerly look forward to all of it!

# What's next

In addition to a new program, I look forward to completing my masters degree in Software Engineering. Next week, I start my last semester of my degree where I will be completing a capstone project. It has been a long ride and I look forward to coming out the other side with a degree to further my career!

Lastly, I am excited to kick off this exciting personal project: self-hosting a website on my Raspberry Pi! Please explore this website and let me know what you think!
