    content: |-
      I am a Software Engineer Senior at Lockheed Martin Space pursuing a masters degree in Software Engineering and holding an Engineering BS with an electrical concentration and a minor in computer science at Elizabethtown College.

      My two passions, space and software development, combine in my current job, where I develop software systems for satellite constellation planning, scheduling, command, and control using cloud computing practices such as Docker and Kubernetes.

      When I'm not at work, I enjoy tinkering around with web applications that I self-host on my Raspberry Pi. Check out [the projects below](#projects) my projects and take a look at my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/AutomationMusician).
